# Stand Density Management Diagram

This application depicts stand density management diagrams (SDMDs) of ponderosa pine as well as some other North American conifer stands via `R`'s `Shiny` app. This application was designed to accomodate the `standview` package, written by M.W. Ritchie from US Forest Service. Detail for the `standview` package is available at: [https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/tools/standview/](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/tools/standview/) and [https://github.com/mwritchie](https://github.com/mwritchie).

## Description

Users can draw different SDMDs by references. Also, users can customize their own SDMDs (i.e., User Defiend option), through modifying maximum SDI, management zone, Reineke's term for self-thinning line, etc. Plot and table into can be downloaded to their computers from the Export Tab. 

## Built with
* R/Rstudio/`Shiny`
* `standview` package
