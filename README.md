# Stand Density Management Diagram

This application depicts stand density management diagrams (SDMDs) of ponderosa pine stands (and mixed-conifer stands in CA) via `R`'s `Shiny` app. This application was designed to accomodate the `standview` package, written by M.W. Ritchie from US Forest Service. Detail for the `standview` package is available at: [https://github.com/mwritchie](https://github.com/mwritchie).

## Description

Users can draw different SDMDs by reference as well as create their own (i.e., User Defiend option), modifying maximum SDI, management zone, Reineke's term for self-thinning line, etc. Users can also download the plot and table into their computers from the Export Tab.
